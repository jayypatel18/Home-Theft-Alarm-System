Introduction -
I have designed an interesting and cheap home security alarm. This gadget helps you to protect your house from thieves. In this project i have used Arduino and various sensors like PIR sensor, Ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, LCD screen, Keypad, motor, lock etc.
You will find the code for Arduino in this repo so that improvements can be made on the code for more smooth working of the system.
